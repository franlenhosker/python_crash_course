# Python Crash Course

The code in this repo describes a crash course in Python, designed by **Tom Hosker**, for his beloved **Franlen Cuanico**.

## Command Line Basics

### Running Python Files

Use:

```sh
python3 [PATH_TO_PYTHON_FILE]
```

For example, to run `hello_world.py`, navigate to the directory containing that file (use `cd` as necessary), and then run `python3 hello_world.py`.

### Making Commits

Git is a big topic! However, for the time being, save your work using the following commands:

```sh
cd ~/python_crash_course
git add .
git commit -m "[DESCRIBE WHAT YOU DID HERE]"
git push origin master
```

Don't worry about what each of those does for the time being. Plenty of time to learn about that later!

If you ever need to resync this repo with what's in the cloud, just call:

```sh
cd ~/python_crash_course
git pull
```
